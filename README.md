## Introduction
Virtual Reality for consumers is starting to grow outside of gaming, it is being used for science, medical and enginneering projects. This project shows, in VR, what are the advantages of using it in the architecture field.

It is a museum-like exibition, with explanation, audio, video and interactive content.

<!--TODO: If you don't have a VR headset, [you can watch the 360 video version.]() -->
